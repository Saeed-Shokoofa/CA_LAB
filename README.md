In this project, I have written an ARM-based verilog code.

It can run all basic instructions without any problem. The bubble sort benchmark was run on it and worked correctly.

You can write your machine code and run it on this CPU just by changing the written instructions in the instruction memory.

It was synthesized and worked on FPGA with Quartus.
